The purpose of this project is to create a software to help the ECM team handle builds and complete repetitive tasks. 

At their current state the ECM's work consists of creating as well as filling out blank spreadsheets and emails each time there is a new build or update to the build. 
The software developed would be able to generate or update build configurations. Once generated and/or updated, the server would then save them into a database and load them into an email to send to ECM. 
The ECM would then be able to add builds, as well as sub-builds under the original builds in order to generate a change log to determine what needs to be completed.  
The intention is to use a database in order to functionally to keep track of all builds. 
To bridge the communication between the database and the user, a GUI will be implemented to layout all functionally in a user friendly fashion.

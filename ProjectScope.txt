The purpose of this project is to create software to help the ECM team handle builds and complete repetitive tasks.
The current state of the ECM work consists of creating and filling out blank spreadsheet and emails, every time there is a new build or update. 
The software would be able to generate or update build configurations.Save them into a database and load them into an email to send the ECM. 
The ECM would then be able to add builds and under them sub builds to generate a change log to determine what needs to be completed.  
The intention to use a database is for the functionally to keep track of all builds. 
To bridge the communication between the database and the user, a GUI will be implemented to layout all functionally in a user friendly fashion.
